# GGR472: Developing Web Maps Lab 3
 Lab on map interactivity in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

# Repository Contents

`index.html`: HTML file to render the map and elements including navigation controls, checkboxes, and a dropdown
`style.css`: CSS file for positioning the map interface and elements
`script.js`: JavaScript file containing code for adding interactivity with map data layers based on HTML element events

# Data Source

This map presents data from the City of Toronto Open Data using data from the 158 neighbourhood model of Toronto and shootings and firearm discharges from 2004 to 2024. The basemap and style were both obtained from mapbox, where the style was slightly modified for use in this lab. This map and webpage were coded using Visual Studio Code and uploaded with GitHub Desktop using the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS coding languages. 

# Objectives

The purpose of this map is to visually present the spatial distribution of shootings and firearm discharge incidents in the city of Toronto. Hearing about gun violence is not the same as visualizing it on a map, in addition to the dropdown bar that allows the user to toggle for the occurrences at different times of the day. The points representing each incident are also classified by number of deaths per incident, and the points can be interacted with to view data points such as date of the occurrence, neighbourhood name and id, coordinates of the nearest intersection, death count, and injury count.
